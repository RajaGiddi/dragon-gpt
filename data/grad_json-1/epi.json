The emphasis will be on the combination of theoretical and methodological ideas and tools. Existing controversies in the field will be highlighted. Topics to be covered include: (a) history of epidemiology, (b) the role of theory in epidemiology, (c) philosophy of science as it pertains to epidemiology, and (d) current discussions about causal inference in epidemiology. Students will discuss hypothesis generation and testing, causal reasoning, and the interplay between theories, models and data.",

            "Description": "This course is a doctoral-level seminar where students engage in discussions and debate about the concepts of bias and validity in epidemiology. The course will cover the theoretical basis of bias and confounding and its implications in practice. Students will perform quantitative bias analysis to explore its impact. The course will review the seminal as well as contemporary papers in bias and validity. Students will learn practical skills that are essential to any rigorous epidemiological investigation and can be used when applying for funding and conducting dissertation research.",

In order to understand the pathologic basis for disease, the course will also cover the normal structure and function of many body systems, that when compromised lead to diseases of public health importance.",

The focus of the course is an understanding of the R computing platform with application to data analysis problems of a public health nature. The interactive classes will feature a lecture component and a laboratory component. The RStudio environment will be the interface used for all classroom discussion, and is strongly recommended.",
