External organizations provide internship opportunities. However, a faculty member in the College of Computing and Informatics (CCI) will supervise students in the academic component. Students will meet regularly with the instructor while working in their internship positions. During the quarter, students will be introduced to Drexel resources that will be helpful during their internships. Formats other than written reports may be used to demonstrate student understandings of the connections between their internships and their CCI studies.
