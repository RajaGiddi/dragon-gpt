            "Description": "A graduate level introduction to evidence-based approaches to teaching STEM undergraduates. Evidence-based pedagogies have been demonstrated to be successful in promoting student learning and success. Students in this course will discuss, research, and practice a number of evidence-based pedagogical approaches and think about implementation strategies for the classroom. Through classroom activities we will engage with a survey of evidence-based teaching approaches so that students can make informed implementation decisions after the course is over. There will be an emphasis on understanding why changes to STEM teaching are important for promoting retention and diversity in STEM fields.",

Through classroom activities we will engage with the vocabulary of evidence-based teaching so that students can continue to learn about these topics after the course is over. There will be an emphasis on understanding why changes to STEM teaching are important for promoting retention and diversity in STEM fields. In this course, students will address approaches to utilizing technology tools to support implementation of active-learning, confront how learning involves more than content and includes metacognition, epistemology, and affective features.",
