            "Description": "Course examines major developmental theories of literacy as they pertain to the development of literacy skills starting from infancy through adulthood. Course will also investigate major theoretical models of reading and writing acquisition and instruction in areas such as constructing literacy rich contexts for K-12 students; integrating literacy skills across the content areas; understanding the relationship between reading, writing, speaking and listening; and understanding the processes of how students develop and use reading and writing practices in meaningful ways. Major theoretical models of reading and writing inform decisions and purposes for using particular instructional practices and strategies in a variety of educational contexts, but with a specific focus on urban settings.",

The course also investigates how linguistic differences and styles of language affect literacy acquisition for students from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, and how literacy teachers can create an inclusive learning environment for all students. Students will learn the critical need for literacy teachers to create effective partnerships with parents from diverse urban communities in supporting the literacy development of their children at home.
