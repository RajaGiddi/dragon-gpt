            "Description": "Climate change poses a host of challenges for American cities, ranging from what trees to plant, to increases in heat-related deaths, to critical infrastructure protection in the face of increasingly severe weather events. And it is an open question as to whether American city governments have the organizational capacity, resources, and political will, to engage in the type of long-term planning that climate change will require. What are the most likely effects that climate change will have on different American cities? What should American cities be doing, and what have American cities done so far, to prepare themselves for climate change? What responsibilities do cities have to try to mitigate the causes of climate change? What factors likely determine American cities\u2019 responses to climate change?.",
