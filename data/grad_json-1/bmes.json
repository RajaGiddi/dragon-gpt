            "Description": "Studies physiology of sensory/motor systems, with emphasis on modeling of neural systems and biomechanical aspects of functional tasks. Begins with an analysis of the transportation of materials in and out of cells, followed by an examination of the origin and maintenance of membrane potentials. Discusses intra-and extracellular and surface measurement of potentials, generation and transmission of action potentials, synaptic processes, and the structure/function of muscle. Combines these elements to study reflex systems as well as vestibular and ocular effects on posture. Culminates in the study of the control of motor systems with respect to bipedal locomotion.",
