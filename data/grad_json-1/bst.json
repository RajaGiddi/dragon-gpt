Students will engage in stages of proposal development by refining quantitative aims for a grant proposal, developing the data management and analysis plans, and conducting the power analysis. They will also develop a scope of work and billing for the biostatistician's participation if/once the grant is funded. Students will be exposed to IRB, data use agreements, human protection training, and data privacy.",
