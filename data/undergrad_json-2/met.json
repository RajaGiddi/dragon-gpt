This course will allow students to apply the theory of design for manufacturing (DFM) and design for assembly (DFA) to the overall design process. Topics include practical techniques for selection of materials and processes, design considerations for production, manual assembly and automated assembly, and Boothroyd and Dewhurst methods. Students review case studies and analyze production assemblies.",
