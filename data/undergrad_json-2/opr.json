            "Description": "This course will cover the basics of analytical modeling, optimization, and simulation as tools for decision-making in the public sector. The students will analyze cases illustrating the powerful impact of using these tools in cities across the country. Of particular focus will be the implementability of these tools and their recommendations in the real-world. Moreover, a city, especially one as big as Philadelphia, is a complex and dynamic environment, so we will investigate how to address some of the resulting challenges in our analyses. Specifically, we will address scenarios involving the improvement of existing operations, optimal resource allocation and distribution, and measuring and improving the quality and efficiency of service delivery.",

            "Description": "Quantitative finance can be grouped into the following categories: (1) valuation of financial instruments by the use of risk-neutral probability distributions; (2) financial planning using real-life probability distributions. This course focuses on financial planning. There are two key ideas: the first is to model decision making and planning as a mathematical optimization problem with variables, an objective function, and constraints. The second is to model uncertainty using the tools of probability theory. This is an introductory course: we focus on building models and use standard spreadsheet software to find solutions.",
