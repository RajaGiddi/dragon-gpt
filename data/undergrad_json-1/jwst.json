A shared heritage unites Jews, yet understandings and interpretations of what it means to be Jewish are hotly contested, especially in the 21st century. In this course, we dig into Jewish thought and history and explore the ways they have shaped ethnic identity, cultural heritage, and religious tradition.",

Christianity is often considered to be diametrically opposed to Judaism, to be a rejection of the Judaic worldview. Indeed, prominent thinkers in the history of Christianity, such as Martin Luther, have reinforced this position. Yet Christianity was originally a development within Judaism, a sect, so to speak, of Judaism. The earliest Christians were Jewish followers of a Jewish leader and conceived of themselves as faithful Jews. So how did the two religions come to be viewed as opposed? Do elements of Judaism remain as part of the foundation of the new faith of Christianity? Where do the two faiths converge and where do they diverge? This course endeavors to answer these important questions.",

What is antisemitism? How did it start? Why is it so enduring? This course will explore the long history of a perplexing and irrational phenomenon.

While the Pittsburgh, San Diego, and Newark shootings, and the Hanukkah attack in Monsey show are the most violent expressions of antisemitism that this country has ever seen, these are not the only times during which Jews were identified as outsiders and a threatening presence. This course will examine Jewish exclusion through the mid-20th century including General Grant\u2019s expulsion of Jews, the Leo Frank lynching and Henry Ford\u2019s Dearborn Independent, Father Coughlin\u2019s antisemitic radio addresses, the Nazi rally and Madison Square Garden.

They owned plantations and participated in extensive trading enterprises in the New World, including sugar cultivation, the triangulated slave trade, trade in precious gems, and the fur-trade. This course will investigate the ways in which Jews participated in colonial environments in the 16th-18th centuries: their business pursuits and their interactions with Europeans, Africans, and Native Americans.
