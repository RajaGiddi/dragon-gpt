CAD simulations are a practical learning component and is designed to prepare students for various industrial design and telecommunication applications.",

            "Description": "This course will teach students the concepts of antennas and photonics using electromagnetics and discuss their utility in design of telecommunications and remote sensing. Antennas are introduced in terms of E&M fields (radiation pattern, polarization), circuits (radiation impedance/admittance, efficiency, bandwidth), and system concepts (directive gain). Examples of line antenna (short electric/magnetic dipoles, arbitrary length dipoles, small loops, travelling and standing wave), array antennas (linear and planar), and aperture radiators (slot, patch, and reflectors). Lightwave propagation in optical fibers (step index, graded index, polarization maintaining) and dielectric structures (slabs, ridge waveguide, buried waveguides) are discussed.",
