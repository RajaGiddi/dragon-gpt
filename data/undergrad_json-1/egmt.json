Based upon Astronaut Ron Garan\u2019s experiences in space, this course focuses on the importance and possibilities of global collaboration and innovation in creating a better world. Students will learn what it is like to work with a diverse group of people in an environment only a handful of human beings have ever known. Students will also learn to apply the orbital perspective here at home, embracing new partnerships and processes to promote peace and combat hunger, thirst, poverty, and environmental destruction. This course is a call to action for each of us to care for the most important space station of all: planet Earth.",
