            "Description": "The legalization of world politics is one of the most interesting and potentially transformational trends in international relations. Across substantive areas, including matters of security, trade, environmental affairs, and human rights, international law is playing an increasing role in international politics. The course considers theoretical approaches and contemporary events to better understand where international law comes from, how it is designed, and why states comply (or not). In addition, we consider contemporary debates and challenges, including the contested jurisdiction of international courts, the immunity of the United Nations, evolving law on humanitarian military intervention, and the fragmentation of international law in environmental affairs, among other topics.",
