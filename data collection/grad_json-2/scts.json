An umbrella term, new materialism refers to a variety of recent attempts to re-imagine nature, sex, body, and matter. During the \"linguistic turn\" of the 20th century, many postmodern feminists retreated from these materials and their associated sciences; enamored of texts but allergic to bodies, postmodern feminists tended to embrace radical constructivism and reject scientific methods and knowledges. Today, new materialists return to biology, nature, sex, body, and matter in order to move beyond the logics of essentialism and somatophobia. This course will survey the results of this return with a special emphasis on understandings of sex and sexual difference.",
