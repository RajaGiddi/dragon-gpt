In each term, two peacebuilding cases will be presented by peacebuilders from federal agencies, multinational organizations, and NGOs. In-class sessions subsequent to the case\u2019s presentation, students: 1) will investigate the case through the literature and discuss the case with members of the peacebuilding community; 2) will explore how techniques learned in the core Peace Engineering classes can be applied to the case; 3) will advocate for engineering and technical approaches that could be applied in similar situations; and 4) will use the case as a springboard for reflective writing about the development of skills and personal growth.",

            "Description": "Peace Engineering is a relatively new topic. This course will apply systems thinking and systems tools in the context of peacebuilding. The course is intended to give an introduction to systems engineering and system dynamics and utilize them for this new application. Topics include system architecting, systems mapping, causal loop diagrams, stock and flow diagrams, data sourcing, decision making and game theory. Specific examples of conflict will be presented and various theories of change will be tested with the system models. This course will utilize some recent literature on systems engineering use in peacebuilding. This is a 3-credit graduate course delivered over a full academic term via Drexel\u2019s online learning management system Blackboard Learn.",

The prevention of violent conflict and the pursuit of a sustainable peace is just such a challenge. Developed in partnership with professional peacebuilders from the PeaceTech Lab and the US Institute of Peace\u2019s Academy for International Conflict Management and Peacebuilding in Washington DC, this course introduces engineering students to the concepts and skills they will need in order to use technology expertise in service of conflict-affected communities. This course provides students with an introduction to the theory and practice of conflict analysis, strategic peacebuilding, and negotiation.",

Cases drawn from historical peacebuilding and stabilization activities will be used to provide a framework from which to understand how communication and facilitation affect the development of a conflict and the ability to resolve conflict without violence. Weekly online classes will include a discussion of a subject\u2019s theory and a presentation of the impact of the theory in practice. The course relies on ongoing reflective analyses to help students link the theories and practices of effective peacebuilding to explorations of personal beliefs. The course will be facilitated by instructors from Drexel and from the peacebuilding community.",

Students will work with faculty advisors during the spring term to arrange opportunities with external partners involved in peacebuilding and community engagement. Students will then work and conduct research with these partners throughout the summer term. Students may elect to work locally, nationally, or internationally as long as the location is approved by Drexel\u2019s International Studies office and the organization approved by Peace Engineering faculty advisors. Opportunities exist with program partners, USIP and Peace Tech Lab, and can be sought with other federal agencies, NGOs, and community service organizations.",
