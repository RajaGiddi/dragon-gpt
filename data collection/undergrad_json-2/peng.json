            "Description": "As the pace of science and technology innovation increases, so too does the role of engineers in solving some of the world's toughest challenges. The prevention of violent conflict and the pursuit of a sustainable peace is just such a challenge. Developed in partnership with professional peacebuilders from the PeaceTech Lab and the US Institute of Peace's Academy for International Conflict Management and Peacebuilding in Washington, DC, this course introduces engineering students to the concept and skills they will need in order to use technology expertise in service of conflict-affected communities.This course provides students with an introduction to the theory and practice of conflict analysis, strategic peacebuilding and negotiation.",
