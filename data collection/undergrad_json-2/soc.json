            "Description": "This course will explore the multitude of democratic theories and democracies in practice that have developed during the last several decades. There have been profound changes to our conceptions of \u2018democracy\u2019 during the past 40 years driven by social movements around the globe seeking to change their societies. What kind of society do we imagine when we talk about \u2018democracy\u2019? We will examine fundamental questions and dilemmas surrounding contemporary democratic culture and we will explore in depth several contemporary democratic movements including feminist, identity based, religiously based, radical, environmentalist, anti-globalization and media activism movements.",

            "Description": "This course will explore the sociological implications of debt, on a personal, local, national and international level. Using our own debt as an ethnographic point of departure, we will collectively analyze personal debt, and through this analysis, link our debt to national debt, to historic debt, to reparations, to dispossession, to austerity, both historic and current, to the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and to alternative strategies to ameliorate debt, such as Jubilee or debt strikes. We will consider our emotional relationships and political commitments to debt, on both a personal level as well as the societal level. Consideration will focus on how gender, race, nationality, and class intersect with debt, and we will use feminist and critical race theories lenses to frame our discussions.",

Starting with earlier examples of \"power over life\" from the 18th and 19th centuries, it will explore themes, dilemmas and complications embedded in the scientific control over life. Topics to be explored include biopower and biocapital, eugenics, race and class, stewardship and bioengineering, new reproductive technologies and reproductive choice, among much, much more. Consideration to feminist, queer and critical race theories will frame much of class discussion.",
