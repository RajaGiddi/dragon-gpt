The course will provide an understanding of the properties of air pollutants, relevant atmospheric chemistry and physical processes, and how pollutants are measured. Students will consider inequities in the impact of air pollutants on human populations across the globe. Students will learn about national programs and policies for the control of air pollutants, and about the international agencies working to solve air pollution as a global health problem.",
