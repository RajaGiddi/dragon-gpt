            "Description": "During the last decades, Middle East and North Africa (MENA) has been in the grips of momentous socio-political conflicts and wars, but most recently, the region has witnessed wide spread uprisings for democratic change. Yet, authoritarianism still dominates politics in the region. This course aims to examine the economic, political, and cultural causes behind the lack of democracy in the region, and will expose students to contrasting perspectives on the topic including structural and cultural arguments. Amongst other examples, we will examine the role of the US, the impact of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict on democracy in the region, and the role of Islamic and women\u2019s movements in the recent Arab uprisings. The course will cover Tunisia, Egypt, Syria, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Iran among others.",
