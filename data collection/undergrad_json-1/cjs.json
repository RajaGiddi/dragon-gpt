We confront the long-standing struggle to balance due process with crime control through the lenses of the police, courts and corrections -- the core elements of the Criminal Justice system. We also examine major crime control paradigms (historic and current), and the tenuous relationship between race and justice. The course offers a variety of educational approaches in an effort to match (as much as is reasonable) students' individual learning styles and needs.",

It then examines urban drug markets, violence, and policing before moving into a discussion of the crime \"peak\" of 1992. The course then follows the ensuing crime drop, examining demographic, economic, and cultural factors that may explain the national crime decline. The course then focuses on violence as a public health issue and on how crime, incarceration, health, housing, and education are all tied to urban crime policy.",

The course also critiques American policing and proposes a reimagined police role that deemphasizes crime fighting and coercive control in favor of protecting life. Throughout the course, students will consider and reconsider the question: If coercion is the defining feature of the police, does every interaction between the police and public have to be coercive?.",

Students will gain competence in each of these areas as we investigate: Why is open data, particularly related to crime and justice, so important? How can the availability of such data increase citizen participation in civil society? How might open data help us move toward a more just society? Should we become advocates for using the data?

We examine variations in socio-demographic structures (age, education ratios, and the concentration of poverty) and the physical environment (housing segregation, density of bars, street lighting) predicts variations between neighborhoods in the level of crime and disorder.",

As a result, misinformed citizens may draw erroneous conclusions about crime, people who commit crime, and crime policies. Mass media and pop culture often misrepresent the complexity of crime and reality of those involved in the criminal justice system. Students will view popular media outlets and evaluate the legitimacy and efficacy of the sources while analyzing the accuracy of criminogenic factors and the criminal justice system as portrayed in movies, memes, podcast, and television shows.",

This course will examine the tools used for crime prediction and the impact of their use on individuals and communities. Students will learn the logic behind the algorithms used for crime prediction so they can understand the ethical implications of crime prediction tools and methodologies. We will learn R through edX so we have some hands on knowledge of one of the post popular tools being used in data science \u2013 focused on criminal justice.",

As the world increasingly globalizes, it becomes increasingly important to understand how countries outside the United States undertake the processes of detecting crime, labeling people \u201ccriminal,\u201d and adjudicating criminal offenders. Is there a common threshold in other countries for determining guilt? Is there a universal standard that governs the presumption or guilt or innocence at the onset of the criminal justice process? How many other countries still use the death penalty? These are questions the course will address in addition to others related to policing, courts, and corrections.",

The course opens with a history of crime mapping, then moves to an examination of several place-based theories of criminology that help explain why crime events often cluster in time and space. The course then uses scenario-based exercises to teach students to work with and manage geospatial data, conduct select spatial analyses, interpret the results of such analyses within the contexts of different criminological theories, and create maps that illustrate spatial patterns and relationships across different units of geography.",

Each week, students will study a policing topic in class and then participate in a simulated police activity hosted by Drexel police officers. These simulated activities include car stops, shoot-don't-shoot scenarios, responding to mass shooting events, and drug seizures. Ultimately, this course hopes to integrate two aspects of American policing that are typically separated: How we teach policing, and how we do policing.",
