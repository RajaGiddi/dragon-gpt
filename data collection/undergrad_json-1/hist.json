By the 1950s, Drexel was a powerhouse as a local provider of technical talent\u2014and it became Drexel University in 1970. As the local economy went through a brutal deindustrial transformation Drexel had to change or face bankruptcy.

            "Description": "This course explores the history of magic, witchcraft, and demonology in Europe and its colonies from antiquity through the late 1700s. Main topics include the origins of European ideas and practices related to the supernatural; how those ideas and practices changed through Middle Ages and Renaissance; why large-scale witch-hunts emerged in early modern European societies; and why such hunts eventually faded out. We also consider questions of historical methods: How should scholars approach the problem of understanding the history of magic, witchcraft, and demonology? What sources can we use? How should we interpret those sources?.",

            "Description": "Between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries, over twelve million Africans crossed the Atlantic in chains. Those who survived, and millions more of their descendants, were bought and sold as commodities and forced to labor under conditions of bondage in places as varied as Brazil, the Caribbean, and North America. Their diverse experiences of exploitation, struggle, perseverance, and liberation lie at the core of the foundation, and entrenchment, of the colonial order in the Americas. This course introduces students to scholarship on the history of the slave societies of the colonial Americas. It will trace how African and Afro-descendant people's varied experiences of slavery and freedom between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries forged an interconnected and diverse Black Atlantic world.",

What are these silences? What forces might be moving behind them? What hidden languages can we find when we question the silences? How do these silences affect our perception of the continent today? What are the ramifications in the world today?.",
