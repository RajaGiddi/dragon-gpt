            "Description": "This course is a graduate level intensive introduction to research methods in behavior analysis. The empirical methods of inquiry used in behavior analysis are substantially different than those used in traditional psychology, with the single subject design serving as the hallmark of behavior analytic research. Therefore, this course is designed to provide knowledge of the concepts and issues related to single-subject design as used in applied behavior analysis research. Topics will include the distinction between single subject and group research designs, issues related to reliability and validity, data collection and analysis techniques, treatment integrity, and other ethical and professional issues.",
