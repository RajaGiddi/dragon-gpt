            "Description": "Decision-making and problem-solving prowess is a skill that can and should be learned. Why do well-intentioned, smart, experienced professionals make poor decisions far too often? It may be because they haven\u2019t been taught a disciplined process for making quality decisions. Perhaps they\u2019ve relied on intuition, brains, luck, common sense, and training within the narrow bounds of their professional expertise. Unfortunately, in today\u2019s professional environment these attributes may not be enough to sustain advantage. This course will help managers build confidence in the quality of their complex problem solving and decision making abilities, making them better leaders, and preparing them for effectively solving future challenges.",
