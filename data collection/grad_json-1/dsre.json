Through hands-on prompted experimentation, selected readings, in-class discussion, instructive editing, and group critique, students will explore unbuilding and rebuilding of design systems. Students will produce several small-scale experiments and create a larger deliverable based on opportunities discovered during the prototyping phase. To produce this work, students will engage with a variety of digital, philosophical, and material fabrication methods. The course aims to enhance student design abilities by promoting the out-of-the-box expansion of traditional design techniques.",
