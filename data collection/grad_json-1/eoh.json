            "Description": "This interdisciplinary course gives an overview of environmental and occupational health (EOH) issues and an introduction to approaches for prevention and control of environmental hazards. The course will cover both traditional EOH topics such as air pollution, drinking water and sanitation, and occupational health and safety, as well as salient issues of global concern such as climate change and emerging infectious diseases. The goal is to provide students with knowledge of the basic scientific principles of EOH, as they apply to the practice of public health. Throughout the course, students will examine environmental injustice and racism, particularly how policies and systems marginalize specific populations and contribute to health disparities.",

WASH services are a critical component of responses to infectious disease epidemics and ensuring infection prevention in healthcare facilities. Contaminated drinking water, inadequate water supply, or poor sanitation and hygiene all contribute to disease burden and decreased quality of life, particularly among the most vulnerable populations. This course will discuss a wide variety of topics related to WASH around the globe and the U.S. and will explore how WASH problems are compounded by emerging infectious diseases, climate change and rapid urbanization.",

Determination of an overall weight-of-evidence for a particular hazard will also be discussed. Through case studies, students will consider strengths and limitations of evidence, the types of biases that may be present, and how differences in interpretation may occur.",
